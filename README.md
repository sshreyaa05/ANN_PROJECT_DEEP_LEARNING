## Predicting Customer Churn Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
### Overview
The project focused on utilizing Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict customer churn using a structured churn modeling dataset. The objective was to build a robust predictive model capable of identifying whether a customer is likely to leave a service (churn) based on historical behavioral and transactional data. The final ANN model achieved a test accuracy of 80%, demonstrating good predictive performance.
### Objective
The goal of this project was to:
1. Analyze and preprocess the provided churn dataset to identify meaningful patterns in customer behavior and usage.
2. Build an ANN model that can predict customer churn by analyzing features (input variables) derived from customer demographics, service usage, account history, and interaction patterns.
3. Optimize the ANN's hyperparameters and architecture to ensure maximum generalization on unseen data.
4. Evaluate the model performance on the test set to ensure accuracy meets business and statistical goals.
## Dataset Overview
The churn dataset consisted of anonymized customer information with features describing:
1. Customer Demographics: Age, gender, income group, location, etc.
2. Service Usage Data: Frequency of service usage, features used, duration of usage, etc.
3. Account History: Tenure, payment history, usage patterns, complaints, billing data, etc.
4. Customer Interaction Data: Response time to support queries, time since last support request, engagement rates, etc.
5. The target variable was a binary indicator:
   
1 (churn): The customer is likely to stop using the service.
0 (no churn): The customer is likely to remain with the service.
