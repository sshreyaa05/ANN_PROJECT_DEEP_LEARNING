## Predicting Customer Churn Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
### Overview
The project focused on utilizing Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict customer churn using a structured churn modeling dataset. The objective was to build a robust predictive model capable of identifying whether a customer is likely to leave a service (churn) based on historical behavioral and transactional data. The final ANN model achieved a test accuracy of 80%, demonstrating good predictive performance.
### Objective
The goal of this project was to:
1. Analyze and preprocess the provided churn dataset to identify meaningful patterns in customer behavior and usage.
2. Build an ANN model that can predict customer churn by analyzing features (input variables) derived from customer demographics, service usage, account history, and interaction patterns.
3. Optimize the ANN's hyperparameters and architecture to ensure maximum generalization on unseen data.
4. Evaluate the model performance on the test set to ensure accuracy meets business and statistical goals.
## Dataset Overview
The churn dataset consisted of anonymized customer information with features describing:
1. Credit Score: Indicator of financial stability.
2. Geography: Categorical feature representing location.
3. Gender: Categorical feature showing demographic patterns.
4. Other Relevant Factors: Derived behavioral features related to customer usage patterns.
5. The target variable was a binary indicator:
   
1 (churn): The customer is likely to stop using the service.

0 (no churn): The customer is likely to remain with the service.

## Insights:
1. Credit Score and Geography were strong predictors of churn risk.
2. Behavioral patterns and demographic variables significantly impacted churn predictions.
## Conclusion:
The ANN model, with 80% test accuracy, successfully predicted customer churn by leveraging key features like Credit Score, Geography, Gender, and behavioral insights. This demonstrates the value of machine learning for proactive customer retention strategies.
